# Stock-Prediction

The objective of this model is to predict the Microsoft stocks. 

I use time series decomposition to break up a time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals.

Time series decomposition is used in time series analysis for tasks such as:

- exploratory data analysis (e.g., has unemployment increased this quarter after adjusting for seasonality?);

- pre-processing time series to identify and impute outliers and missing data;

- extracting features from time series for later use in classification, regression, and forecasting tasks;

- building forecasts (e.g., the components can be forecasted separately and then aggregated to produce the final forecast).
